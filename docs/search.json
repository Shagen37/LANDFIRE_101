This product can improve the accuracy of fire behavior predictions if the local weather has been different from normal. Seasonal fuel products are created for two specific regional fuel situations (1) drought conditions in the Southeast and parts of the Northeast United States (U.S.) and (2) greater than normal abundance of annual herbaceous fuel loading in the Great Basin and Southwest U.S. Note that the name of the Seasonal Fuels product was previously Mod-FIS.",

In FCCS, fuelbeds represent the structure and composition of wildland fuels and can accommodate a wide range of fuel characteristics in six horizontal fuel layers called strata (Ottmar and others 2007).\n\n\nFuel Loading Models\nFuel Loading Models (FLM) are available in the LF2001 and LF2008 versions. The FLM surface fuel classification system characterizes provides a simple and consistent way to describe onsite fuels for use in fire behavior and fire effects models.

    "text": "What you will find in this section\nThe Reference Conditions Table (RCT) is an output from the Biophysical Settings Models that focuses specifically on succession class and fire regime. In this section we will:\n\nExplore the fields in the Reference Conditions Table\nUnderstand how the Reference Conditions Table is linked to the BpS through succession class\nDiscuss Reference Conditions Table use cases\nExplain where to get the Reference Conditions Table\n\n\n\nThe Reference Conditions Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n💡 We suggest you review the content on Biophysical Settings, specifically the Biophysical Settings Spatial Data page where we discuss BpS attributes, before you work through this material. We discuss Succession Class in more detail in a later section of this website. Remember that reference conditions relate to the pre-European colonization period and not today or the future.\n\n\nThe Reference Conditions Table summarizes the vegetation and fire regime reference conditions for every BpS. Vegetation reference conditions estimate the relative proportion of each succession class. Fire regime reference conditions estimate the frequency and severity of fire within a BpS. LANDFIRE calculates reference conditions using the BpS model. These results are also in the BpS description.\nWhen you download the Reference Condition Table you will get a zipped .csv file with the following fields:\n\nBiophysical Settings identifiers:\n\nBpS_Code\nBpS_Name\nModel_Code\n\nSuccession Class Reference Percents, Classes A – E, e.g., ‘ClassA_ReferencePercent’\nFire Return Intervals, surface, mixed, and replacement, e.g., ‘FRI_ReplacementFire’\nPercent of fires, surface, mixed, and replacement, e.g., ‘PercentOfFires_ReplacementFire’\nFire Regime Group: FRG_New.

The class letters are defined in the Succession Classes Description section of the document.\n\n\n\n\nSome common uses of the Reference Conditions Table\nThis table can be a quick way to get reference percentages and to understand overall historical fire dynamics of BpS. LANDFIRE Uses the RCT to compare reference succession class amounts to current amounts to calculate vegetation departure.\nOther common uses of the RCT include:\nGetting reference succession class percentages when making charts such as the demo figure below. This figure depicts reference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion and could be helpful when thinking about the major Biophysical Settings on a landscape and how their succession classes may (or may not) have changed over time.\n\n\n\nReference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion.\n\n\nUnderstanding the relative proportion of surface, mixed, and replacement fire severity for a given BpS.\nComparing fire frequency, severity, and fire regime between BpS.\nQuickly calculating estimated historical annual acres burned:\n\nQuantify the amount of a BpS on the landscape: Let ( A ) represent the acres of the landscape. For example, ( A = 200,000 ) acres.\nQuantify the return interval: Let ( R ) be the return interval. For this example, ( R = 25 ), so the annual probability ( P ) is given by: P = 1/R = 1/25 = 0.04\nCalculate the Area Affected by Surface Fire: You multiply the acres on the landscape by the return interval. The area affected ( S ) can be calculated as: S=A×P\nPutting it all together, the equation becomes:\nS=200,000×(0.04)=8,000 acres of surface fire\n\nThe following chart depicts annual acres burned, all fire types, for the most dominant BpSs of the Southern Rockies, calculated using the formula above but including all fire types. Explore the context for this chart.\n\n\n\nAnnual acres burned for all fire types in the Southern Rockies biophysical settings.\n\n\nThe reference conditions table is important in landscape assessments and LANDFIRE’s vegetation departure, both of which we will discuss more in-depth in future sections of this learning website.\n\n\nWhere to find the Reference Conditions Table\nThe RCT is downloadable on the Bps Models page of the LANDFIRE Program website.

The BpS code and class name link the succession class to the BpS model. For more detail on this, see our linking the BpS models and descriptions pdf.\nThe number to the right of the class letter represents the modeled reference condition for that class.

    "text": "Model Parameters Table\nThis table is essentially an export of the SyncroSim BpS model parameters. In other words, this table compiles information provided by model developers about the probability and impact of natural disturbances into the modeling software.\nIn the Model Parameters Table below, the top row would read something like “the wind/weather/stress disturbance would impact the Early1:All succession class once every 1000 years on average (or 0.001% of the succession class yearly on average), and when that disturbance happened, the vegetation would respond by returning back to the beginning of the Early1: All succession class.”\nReset age class start after disturbance\nIn ST-Sim, the ‘Age Reset’ field indicates whether a transition resets the age of a simulation cell to the ‘Age Min’ of the destination class. If the value is yes, the age is reset; if no, the age remains unchanged. According to LANDFIRE standards, probabilistic transitions that do not change the class do not reset the age (Age Reset = No), except for class A to A replacement disturbances. Transitions that result in a state change do reset the age (Age Reset = Yes).\nYears since last disturbance\nYears since last disturbance, referred to as TST Min (time-since-transition minimum) in SyncroSim, specifies the minimum number of years that must pass before a transition can occur. In LANDFIRE models, this is used only with Alternative Succession transitions and is related to fire disturbances (surface, mixed, and replacement). For example, if an Alternative Succession transition has a TST Min value of 20, it means that this transition can only happen if 20 years have passed since the last fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisturbance Type\nDisturbance occurs in\nMoves vegetation to\nDisturbance Probability\nReturn Interval (yrs)\nReset Age to New Class Start Age after Disturbance?\nYears Since Last Disturbance\n\n\n\n\nWind or Weather Stress\nEarly1:ALL\nEarly1:ALL\n0.001\n1000\nYes\n0\n\n\nReplacement Fire\nEarly1:ALL\nEarly1:ALL\n0.001\n1000\nYes\n0\n\n\nAlternative Succession\nMid1:OPN\nLate1:CLS\n1\n1\nYes\n100\n\n\nMixed Fire\nMid1:OPN\nMid1:OPN\n0.001\n1000\nNo\n0",

    "text": "What you will find in this section\n\nWhat LANDFIRE data streaming is\nWho should use LANDFIRE data streaming\nSeveral ways to access LANDFIRE data via data streaming\nHelpful resources for accessing and using the LANDFIRE data streams\n\n\n\nAccessing data with LANDFIRE Data Streaming\nThe LANDFIRE Data Streams are a practical option for those who don’t want to (or need to) download datasets and just want to use data for display. This option can also be used to stream data into ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online for analysis. There are several ways you can access data via data stream, all of which are found on the Data page of the LANDFIRE Program website under the ‘Stream Data’ heading.\nWe discuss each of these options in more depth below, and you can also find more information by clicking the links for each data stream type from the LANDFIRE Program website.\n\n\n\nAccessing data with LANDFIRE Products Service\nThe LANDFIRE Products Service (LFPS) is a powerful tool that allows users to download various landscape data products. Here’s a quick overview to get you started:\n\nWhat is LFPS?\n\nLFPS is a service that provides access to a wide range of landscape data products through a REST API. This allows you to request and download LANDFIRE products through an API using HTTPS requests.\n\nHow to Make a Request\n\nTo get data, you’ll need to specify certain parameters in your request, such as the product layer you want and the area of interest. This helps the service understand exactly what data you need.\nThe LFPS can be accessed in several ways:\n\nPython, php, unix wget, or anything that can call a URL (including an internet browser)\nScripting tools like Postman\nThrough ESRI’s REST API/Web Interface using the LANDFIRE Product Service URL\n\n\nCustomizing Your Request\n\nYou can customize your data request with optional settings like output projection (how the data is mapped) and resample resolution (the detail level of the data).\n\nUnderstanding Responses\n\nWhen you make a request, you’ll receive messages that tell you if your request was successful or if there were any errors. These messages help you troubleshoot and ensure you get the data you need.\n\n\nFor more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the full LANDFIRE Products Service User Guide.\n\n\nESRI Image Service\nESRI Image Service, also known as ArcGIS Image Server or simply Image Server, is a component of the ArcGIS platform. ESRI Image Services allow you to view and interact with raster datasets in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online. This service makes it easy to access LANDFIRE spatial datasets without needing to download them to your computer.\nThe benefit of using the ESRI image service over other data streaming such as WCS and WMS is that image services and hosted imagery layers allow you to perform analyses and view pop-ups, pixel information, and attributes rather than just viewing the data with no additional information or capabilities.\nTo use ESRI Image Service (ArcGIS Image Server) in combination with LANDFIRE spatial data, you’ll need to follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt’s important to follow the documents linked below very carefully, as the Image Service URLs are set up for ArcMap and previous versions of ArcGIS Online. There are additional steps you may need to take in order to make the image service rasters work as expected.\n\n\n\nArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro): Add the image service as a layer in your map document following the process outlined in the How to use Image Service URLs in ArcPro document found on the LANDFIRE Stream Data page of the LANDFIRE Program website.\nArcGIS Online: Open the Image Services URL for the project you’re interested in using (found on the LANDFIRE Stream Data page of the LANDFIRE Program website).\n\nFrom here you can click on the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer link at the top of the page. This will open the image service layer page on ArcGIS Online where you can view metadata and attributes.\nTo view the spatial data in a map, you must open the layer in a Map View.\nFor more detailed instructions, please see the How to Use Image Services in ArcGIS Online document, found on the LANDFIRE Stream Data page\n\nWeb mapping platforms like Leaflet, OpenLayers, or Cesium: Use the REST endpoint of the image service along with appropriate WMS or tile layer options.\nAnalyze and process LANDFIRE data:\n\nWith the LANDFIRE image service added to your map, you can perform various spatial analysis tasks, such as:\n\nOverlaying LANDFIRE data with other raster or vector datasets for combined analysis.\nUsing tools like Zonal Statistics, Map Algebra, or Raster Calculator to derive new information from LANDFIRE data.\nApplying image processing techniques (e.g., band math, hillshade, or reclassification) to enhance the visual representation or extract specific features.\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use ESRI Image Service to publish and access LANDFIRE spatial data for further analysis and visualization within the ArcGIS platform.\n\n\nWeb Map Service and Web Coverage Service\nThe OpenGIS® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) is an HTTP interface for requesting and serving geospatial map images over the internet. A WMS request defines the geographic layer(s) and area of interest to be processed and serves, or responds, with one or more geospatial map images that are able to be displayed in a browser application. A WMS call allows you to access and view LF data within your desktop mapping session that are formatted as they appear on the LF Map Viewer.\nWeb Coverage Service (WCS) is also an HTTP interface that provides an open specification for sharing datasets on the web. WCS allows you to access LF products for analysis or modeling without downloading data. WCS provides the pixel value of the data.\n\nHawaii only: The provided WCS URLs will work with ESRI tools. QGIS and other non-ESRI products will be unable to use the WCS URL to view the Hawaii LF data as it is projected in ESRI 102007. Users can use non-ESRI products to view downloaded LF data from the map viewer or mosaic download.\n\nYou can find the WMS and WCS urls on the LANDFIRE Stream Data page on the LANDFIRE Program website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou cannot change symbology or do analysis with the WMS or WCS. You can simply view the data and display it in your maps.\n\n\nFor information on how to use these products within ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro, please see the instructions on how to use WCS and WMS calls in Arc on the LANDFIRE Program Website. You can find these at the bottom of the LANDFIRE Stream Data page.\n\nInstructions on how to use WCS or WMS Calls\nInstructions on how to use WCS or WMS Calls in ArcGis Pro\nInstructions on how to use ArcGIS Online\n\n\n\nArcGIS Online\nYou can also simply find the LANDFIRE data layers in the ArcGIS Online catalog and access them (as hosted imagery services) in ArcGIS Online or via the portal in ArcGIS Pro. To do this, you need to know the name of the dataset you’re looking for or know the direct URL or feature ID, found on the item page on ArcGIS Online.\nUSGS has collected LANDFIRE datasets in their gallery on ArcGIS Online.

This site allows you to explore LANDFIRE datasets online, and to download them based on a rectangle you draw, a polygon you draw, a template (e.g., a state, from a dropdown) or a GeoJSON. This method is most useful if you need several datasets and/or focus on one area and/or have data storage limitations.\nDownload Mosaics for CONUS, HI or AK, or the U.S. Insular Areas. Obtaining these mosaiced datasets are best for users who have several landscapes of interest and/or have plenty of storage space.\nStream data with the LANDFIRE Product Service, or by webservice (WCS, WMS, or ESRI Image Service). You can also access hosted imagery layers in ArcGIS Online from the U.S. Geological Survey gallery. These options are good for users who do not want to store data locally.\nThe rlandfire R package, by Mark Buckner who is currently (as of January 2024) a PhD candidate at Cornell University. This package allows you to import LANDFIRE data directly into your R environment.

At that time, it was the only consistent mid-scale, continent-wide classification available and its ecological foundation fit the needs of the project as designed. Ecological Systems is currently used in the Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) and Biophysical Settings (BpS) spatial layers, the Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions products, and Historic Fire Regime. Three other classifications are provided as attributes of the EVT layer: National Vegetation Classification Group (NVCG), National Vegetation Classification Macrogroup (NVCM) and Society of American Foresters/Society of Range Management (SAF/SRM) Cover Type. The only classification that is directly mapped by LANDFIRE at the present time is ES. NVCG is provided as a separate spatial layer in LF2016 but its attributes and SAF/SRM’s attributes, are created using a crosswalk with ES. Since the National Vegetation Classification is hierarchical, NVCM is created by rolling-up NVCG into the next highest level of the classification.\n\n\nWhat you will find in this section\n\nA brief overview of some commonly used datasets\nHow to download and access LANDFIRE datasets\nHow these key LANDFIRE datasets are linked to one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill have questions?

This combines the BpS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BpS with the same name and BpS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‘Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest’ BpS (13020), which has four different BpS Models:\n\n13020_40 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 40)\n13020_63 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 40)\n13020_65_66 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 65 and 66)\n13020_65_66 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 65 and 66)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote, there will be a separate row, and VALUE for each BPS_CODE/MapZone combination, such as presented in the above example where there are two rows for 13020_65_66.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe attribute for map zone in the BpS attribute table creates duplicate rows in the table in cases where one model applies to multiple map zones. For users only interested in unique BpS, we recommend performing a spatial lookup based on the BpS_Model code. This will allow the user to visualize each unique BpS in an area of interest.\n\n\n\nBPS_NAME: The name of the Biophysical Setting. The name is matched to the BpS Code, not the BpS model number.\nGROUPVEG: Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BpS. Note that if a BpS is listed as ‘Hardwood’ it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but hardwoods are defined as the dominant vegetation type\nPre-European Colonization Fire Regime Attributes:\n\nFRI_REPLAC: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BpS.\nFRI_MIXED: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BpS.\nFRI_SURFAC: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BpS.\nFRI_ALLFIR: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BpS.\nPRC_REPLAC: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BpS.\nPRC_MIXED: Percent of historic fires with mixed serverity for the BpS.\nPRC_SURFAC: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BpS.\nFRG_NEW: The fire regime group for the BpS. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016 and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the Attribute Data Dictionary (https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/DataDictionary/LF2020/LF20_BPSADD_220.pdf) for the BpS spatial data.\n\n\nThe LANDFIRE spatial data layers allow for display and analysis on multiple attributes and at varying levels of specificity. Three examples of how you can display, aggregate, and evaluate Biophysical Settings information are presented in the following images.\n\n\n\nBiophysical Settings data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the BpS_Name attribute. In this map Biophysical Settings are grouped into seven major vegetation classes and displayed using one color family for each class. This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiophysical Settings data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the GROUPVEG attribute. In this map Biophysical Settings are displayed using one color for each major vegetation group (conifer, mixed hardwood-conifer, hardwood, grassland, savannah, riparian, shrubland, sparse vegetation). This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiophysical Settings data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the FRG_NEW attribute. This map explores the fire regime attributes of the Biophysical Settings data, with more frequent fire areas in reds and oranges, moderate frequency fire areas in yellow and pale green, and lower frequency fire areas in shades of blue.

Seriously, after installing packages and libraries some of the functions just work better if you do so.\nIf it is not there, open the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models library by going to File -&gt; Open then navigating to the Reference-Condition-Models.ssim file, likely in your SyncroSim directory. You will then click Open.\nOnce opened, the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models will be in the Library Explorer pane.

Now you have a library with a subset of strata (i.e., BpS in this case) that you care about. Now what?\nBy exploring the BpS models you can learn how the modeling experts parameterized them, and more interactively see how the disturbances and states all fit together.\nStart exploring:\n\nDouble click on Reference Condition Models then the Transition Pathways tab.\nTo make viewing easier go to Window -&gt; Arrange All.\nAt the bottom will be tabs of all of the BpSs that are in this library. Click any one. See Transitions Pane.\nClick on any box to see the pathways associated with that state (i.e., succession class).\nIf you want to run the scenario:\n\nGo to the Output Options tab within the scenario, make sure that the ‘State classes every’ box is set to 100 (i.e., not 1).\nGo to the Run Control tab and set the Total iterations to 2.\nIn the Initial Conditions tab, insure that the Total Acres and Number of Simulation Cells boxes both have 1,000 For exploring we recommend these three steps as it will speed up your runs.\nIn the Library Explorer highlight the scenario, then click the small green triangle at the top of the screen.\n\nMake a chart by clicking the New icon in the Charts pane, then name it appropriately. You will change some settings to get your first chart:\n\nChange Line Chart to Column Chart (top left of window)\nUnder State Classes select Proportion\nUnder Disaggregate by check the State Class box\nUnder Include Data For, click State Class then select the appropriate state classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple BpS, you will also want to go to and select one Model under the Include Data For dropdown\n\n\n-   Click Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nST-Sim is stochastic, so every time a model is run the results will be slightly different. If you run a BpS model in ST-Sim, you can expect the modeled succession class percents to be within +/-5% of the values reported in the BpS description and the reference condition table.\n\n\n\nScreenshots of running a model and making a chart\n\n\n\nState class outputs\n\n\n\n\n\nRun your model\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up your column chart",

Note that if an EVT Lifeform is listed as ‘tree’ it may actually be a mix of tree, herb, savanna, and more, but the ecological system and LANDFIRE identified trees as dominating most of the landscape. LANDFIRE identifies a pixel as belonging to a certain Lifeform if greater than 10% of that pixel is in that Lifeform.\nEVT_GP_N: The vegetation type name (e.g. grassland and steppe, longleaf pine, yellow birch-sugar maple forest). This is more specific than the lifeform, but less specific than the ecological system (EVT Name).\nEVT_PHYS: Vegetation physiognomy of the ecological system (e.g. Grassland, Riparian, Herbaceous, Sparsely Vegetated)\nSAF_SRM: Society of American Foresters/Society for Range Management cover types. This cross walk is intended to help users familiar with the SAF and SRM classifications orient to the EVT types acknowledging that the classifications may not be equivalent.\nEVT_ORDER: FGDC Vegetation physiognomic order (highest level/most general classification, e.g. Tree Dominated)\nEVT_CLASS: FGDC Vegetation class (mid level/more specific, e.g. Closed tree canopy)\nEVT_SBCLS: FGDC Vegetation subclass (lowest level/most specific, e.g. Deciduous closed tree canopy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLANDFIRE EVT can be used at a variety of scales but should only be used after conducting a local review to confirm data accuracy.\nCaution should be taken when comparing LANDFIRE versions as attribute tables are often changed to reflect the changing needs of users.\n\n\nThe LANDFIRE spatial data layers allow for display and analysis at varying levels of specificity. Three examples of how you can display, aggregate, and evaluate Existing Vegetation Type data from most specific (EVT Name) to least specific (Lifeform) information are presented in the following images. These three maps are presented as examples, but you can display or analyze EVT data on any of the attributes mentioned above.\n\n\n\nExisting Vegetation Type data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the EVT_Name attribute. In this map Existing Vegetation Type data are grouped into seven major vegetation classes and displayed using one color family for each class, with each EVT getting its own specific color code. This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting Vegetation Type data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the EVT_Phys attribute. In this map Existing Vegetation Type data are grouped into thirteen major classes and displayed using one color for each class. This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting Vegetation Type data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the EVT_LF attribute.
