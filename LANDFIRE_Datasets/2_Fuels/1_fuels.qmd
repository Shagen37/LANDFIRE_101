# What are LANDFIRE Fuels?

Fuels are downstream LANDFIRE products that represent composition and characteristics of life and dead vegetative matter which are of particular importance to the wildland fire community. LANDFIRE provides spatial layers that represent both [Anderson 13](https://landfire.gov/fuel/fbfm13) and [Scott and Burgan 40](https://landfire.gov/fuel/fbfm40) Surface Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM) in each delivered version. In addition, spatial layers of [Forest Canopy Bulk Density](https://landfire.gov/fuel/cbd) and [Forest Canopy Base Height](https://landfire.gov/fuel/cbh) are also provided. Refer to the links to learn how each of these layers is created.

# How are LANDFIRE Fuels data created and updated?

## Updating Fuels for Landscape Disturbances

As with all LANDFIRE current time period spatial products, fuels layers are only updated for disturbed pixels. The LANDFIRE version name refers to the latest landscape disturbances that have been included. Prior to LF2023, 10 years of disturbance were updated, e.g., in LF2022 disturbances from 2013 – 2022 are used to update vegetation and fuels. In LF 2023 20 years of disturbance were included representing landscape changes from 2004 – 2023. For LF2001 – LF2014 versions pixels not identified as disturbed by LANDFIRE represent conditions in 2001, the most recent prior update. For LF2016 – 2023 pixels not identified as disturbed represent conditions in 2016, the most recent prior update.

## Capable Fuels

Capable fuels are updated to represent conditions of the year of delivery of the data. LF 2016 fuels products in disturbed areas were revised to forecast 2019 or 2020 vegetation conditions for disturbances that occurred between 2009-2016 or 2010-2016, respectively, making the fuels products [2019 or 2020 capable](https://landfire.gov/data/lf2016). LF 2016 capable fuels layers better represent current wildfire behavior on the landscape for the year of delivery. The fuel products with the capable fuels functionality were Fuel Disturbance, Canopy Height, Canopy Cover/Base Density/Base Height, Fire Behavior Fuel Model 13 and 40, Fuel Vegetation Cover/Type/Height, and Fuel Characteristic Classification System.

# Some key LANDFIRE Fuels Products

## Mod-FIS Seasonally Adjusted Fuels

Standard LANDFIRE surface fuel products assume a typical weather year and are constant. However, wildland fuels are not necessarily static. They can vary across a year due to weather patterns, excessive rain, drought, etc. LANDFIRE initiated the Modeling Dynamic Fuel with an Index System ([MoD-FIS](https://www.landfire.gov/fuel/lfmodfis)) to adjust the most recently released Scott and Burgan 40 Fire Behavior Fuel Model (FBFM40) product to reflect drought or seasonable moisture conditions in some areas of the Continental US. This product can improve the accuracy of fire behavior predictions if the local weather has been different from normal. MoD-FIS products are created for two specific regional fuel situations (1) drought conditions in the Southeast and parts of the Northeast United States (U.S.) and (2) greater than normal abundance of annual herbaceous fuel loading in the Great Basin and Southwest U.S. LANDFIRE is currently considering renaming this product, so be aware that it could change in the future.

## LANDFIRE Total Fuels Change Tool

The [LANDFIRE Total Fuels Change Tool](https://landfire.gov/resources/lftfc) (LFTFCT) is an Arc Toolbar developed by LANDFIRE to assign FBFM40 and FBFM13 to each pixel using rulesets based on input products provided by LANDFIRE. The tool is a part of the LANDFIRE production process but is also available to users for modifying surface fuel models locally. Refer to the LFTFCT User Manual for details on how to install and utilize the tool.

## Special Fuels Products

### Fuel Characterization and Classification System

In alternating years LANDFIRE produces a spatial layer representing the Fuel Characterization and Classification System. Fuel Characteristic Classification System ([FCCS](https://www.landfire.gov/fuel/fccs)) defines a [fuelbed](https://www.fs.usda.gov/pnw/fera/research/tutorials/materials/fccs_tutorial_html/index.htm) as the inherent physical characteristics of fuel that contribute to fire behavior and effects and can represent a wide variety of scales. In FCCS, fuelbeds represent the structure and composition of wildland fuels and can accommodate a wide range of fuel characteristics in six horizontal fuel layers called strata (Ottmar and others 2007).

### Fuel Loading Models

Fuel Loading Models ([FLM](https://www.landfire.gov/fuel/flm)) are available in the LF2001 and LF2008 versions. The FLM surface fuel classification system characterizes provides a simple and consistent way to describe onsite fuels for use in fire behavior and fire effects models. FLMs contain representative loading for each fuel component (e.g., woody and non-woody) for typical vegetation classification systems. They characterize fuel loading across all vegetation and ecological types.

# Where to find LANDFIRE Fuels data

The fuels data products are included in the [Fuel section](https://landfire.gov/fuel) of the LANDFIRE Program Website. You can access this from the buttons across the top of the page (#1 in the screenshot below).

Here you will find general information about some of the products mentioned above. The page also includes links to all fuel products delivered by LANDFIRE (#2 in the screenshot below). Each fuels-specific product page has more information on that fuels product along with links to download the fuel product - via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer, full extent downloads, and a variety of ways to stream data into your maps. The page also includes resources such as attribute tables, metadata, and supplemental information.

In a [later section of this site](../../../Get_Data/1-ways-to-get-data.qmd), you will learn more about the differences between these download methods and how to access data via each method.
