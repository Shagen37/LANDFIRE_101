# Full Extent Mosaics

For users who want to assess larger landscapes (all of CONUS, the full US, or large regions encompassing multiple states or map zones), or users who frequently work in different landscapes around the US, we recommend downloading full extent mosaics. LANDFIRE delivers these as they are available for each product and each release. You can select which version, which theme (Disturbance, Fire Regime, Fuel, Reference, Topographic, Vegetation) and which region (CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Insular Areas) you are interested in.

::: callout-important
CONUS releases in GeoAreas (pieces) throughout the calendar year, so the latest version available may not include all of CONUS. See each specific version page [here](https://landfire.gov/data) for more information.

# Downloading Data

::: callout-note
Not all datasets are available with every version. See the [data page on the LANDFIRE Program Website](https://landfire.gov/data#versions) to begin learning about versions.
:::

1.  Once you are on the Full Extent Downloads page, you will see three dropdown menus - one for version, one for Theme, and one for Region ID. These will help you limit your search so you can find the data you need more easily.

    -   For example, let’s search for LF 2022 Vegetation data for CONUS. To do so, we select Version: LF2022 - Theme: Vegetation, Region ID: CONUS, then hit apply. This narrows our search to only CONUS-wide vegetation projects from LANDFIRE 2022.

::: callout-tip
If you would like multiple versions, multiple regions, or multiple themes of data, simply leave that dropdown as -Any- and you will have the option to download whichever datasets you’d like. You cannot select multiple items from the dropdowns, and you will need to download each dataset individually.
:::

2.  From here, we can select from EVC, EVH, EVT, SClass, VCC, and VDep. BpS is not an option because BpS data were not created in LF 2022. To find the most recent versions of your dataset of interest, see the [version comparison table](https://landfire.gov/data/comparison-table) on the LANDFIRE Program Website.

3.  Find the dataset(s) you are interested in, and click the Download link to the right of the dataset name. This will begin downloading a zip file. The zipped data will likely land in your ’Downloads’ directory unless you specified another location.

4.  Extract the data to a useful location, then begin using LANDFIRE data in your projects and analyses.

::: callout-note
Many of the full extent mosaics are very large files. The downloads will take several minutes. We recommend downloading them while connected to your best available internet connection and making sure you have several gigabytes of storage space available in your download location.
